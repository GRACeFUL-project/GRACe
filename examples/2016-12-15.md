pump:
* ToCr: more intuitive to have both an inflow and an outflow (even if
  they are always the same in the current model, we may want to
  generalise to a leaking pump later etc.)

storage:
* Some improvements and refactoring in the constraints
* Introducing an internal variable (currentV)
    * using createPort even though this is not exported as a port
	* we may want to use another name later
* time?
   * At some point we will need to introduce time
   * then "old" and "new" values will pop up: currentV and nextV, say
