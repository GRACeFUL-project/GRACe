# TODO

## GCM
* Generalise the return types for GCM components,
  so they can fit together easily
* Actions
* Goals
* Code-Generation with output

## CP
* Code-Generation

Maybe we need to be able to expose parameters, for two reasons:
1. To be able to affect them using actions
2. To be able to pose constraints like:
   Make the pump go at full capacity when
   possible
